              Education is critical to the alleviation of poverty; it improves
              health and productivity, drives gender parity and promotes
              opportunities for upward mobility. It is the foundation of the
              nation’s socio-economic development and can be considered the most
              important investment for progress.From an individual perspective,
              education sparks a pursuit of knowledge and love for learning,
              fosters confidence and self-esteem, and helps individuals to
              maximise their potential and engage in a meaningful manner in the
              civic, economic, cultural and social aspects of society.

      <p>
        Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has acquired new dimensions in the
        arena of business world in recent years. Today, companies are
        proactively taking up this good hearted investment and giving a social
        value to all their business endeavours.
      </p>

      <p>
        In India, though corporate have a strong will to dedicate their
        resources for a social cause, they find it difficult to reach out to the
        right people considering the demography and diverse social problems of
        the country. MESCO is one such catalyst that works towards the needs of
        development while helping corporate in investing in their social
        initiatives. MESCO helps corporate in strengthening their CSR programmes
        by letting them adopt, initiate or partner in various schemes.
      </p>
      <p>
        India is the first country to have mandated CSR spending on companies
        with net worth of INR 500/- crores or more, or turnover of INR 1000/-
        crores or more, or net profit of INR 5/-crores or more in a financial
        year. Companies falling under these categories are mandated to spend 2%
        of their average net profits on social activities since April 2013.

              "Mushira Mudassir Ansari, 17 months old special baby girl is
              resident of Kurla Quresh Nagar Hill. The family belongs to
              Jharkhand. She was diagnosed and treated for infantile hypotonia
              and delayed motor milestone. The condition was causing delayed
              developmental milestones like walking, speaking, sitting and other
              physical activities as per her age. Her mother visited the MESCO
              Physiotherapy Clinic in May 2019. The primary goal was to enable
              and correct the condition of her lower limb, thus enabling her to
              sit with least support. Within one and half months she started
              sitting on her own and crawling. In the last four and half months
              Mushira has been undergoing therapy and is showing positive
              results. By the end of September, she was able to stand with
              minimum support and walk on her own with support. The change in
              the condition of Mushira’s health has brought happiness to her
              family. They are very thankful to MESCO."
